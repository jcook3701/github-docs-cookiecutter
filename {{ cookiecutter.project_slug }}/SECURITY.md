# Security Vulnerabilities

The {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} is built with security and data privacy in mind to ensure your data is safe.

## Reporting
We are grateful for security researchers and users reporting a vulnerability to us, first. To ensure that your request is handled in a timely manner and non-disclosure of vulnerabilities can be assured, please follow the below guideline.

__Please do not report security vulnerabilities directly on GitHub. GitHub Issues can be publicly seen and therefore would result in a direct disclosure.__

For reporting a vulnerability, please send an email directly to <jcook3701+{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}-security@gmail.com>. Please address questions about data privacy, security concepts, and other media requests for Security Researchers on our team.

## Disclosure Handling
We are committed to timely review and respond to your request. The resolution of code defects will be handled by a dedicated group of security experts and prepared in a private GitHub repository. The project will inform the public about resolved security vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories.
